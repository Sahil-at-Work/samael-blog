	<h3>My Personal Tech Setup: A Mr. Robot Inspired Journey</h3>

	<p>
		In the spirit of Mr. Robot, let me take you on a journey through my personal tech setup. I have
		a home lab consisting of four devices, each with its own unique name and inspiration:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>"The Flaming Sword" - My laptop:</strong> This device is named after the legendary sword
			capable of breaking through reality itself. Similarly, my laptop serves as the gateway to my
			digital world, enabling me to explore new possibilities, conquer challenges, and unleash my
			creativity.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>"Wings of Fire" - My smartphone:</strong> Inspired by the beautiful wings of Lucifer in
			his angelic form, my smartphone symbolizes the power of mobility and connectivity. It allows
			me to stay connected, access information on the go, and explore the vast realm of
			possibilities offered by the digital landscape.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>"Codex" - My Raspberry Pi:</strong> Named after the Codex Gigas, famously known as the
			Devil's Bible, my Raspberry Pi is a versatile and compact device. It serves as a playground
			for my experiments, enabling me to tinker with various projects and explore the vast
			potential of hardware automation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Multiple Virtual Machines:</strong> As a Linux enthusiast, I enjoy experimenting with
			different distributions. <mark>Fedora 37</mark> is my primary workstation, providing a stable
			and secure environment for my daily tasks. However, I also have a soft spot for <mark
				>Manjaro</mark
			> and <mark>Linux Mint</mark>, which I use for specific projects and exploration.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		My heart beats in synchrony with the ethereal rhythms of <strong
			>Linux</strong
		>. <mark>Fedora 37</mark>, my faithful companion, serves as the vessel for my creative
		endeavors. Yet, I find solace in the embrace of <mark>Manjaro</mark> and <mark>Linux Mint</mark>,
		each whispering their own enchanting melodies. In the labyrinthine labyrinth of open-source
		technology, I find solace, liberation, and a sanctuary for my restless soul.
	</p>

	<p>
		Within the sacred confines of this website, you shall discover the tapestry of my
		<a href="/projects">projects</a>, each thread meticulously woven with dedication and
		innovation. Journey alongside me through the corridors of my mind, as I share profound insights
		and wisdom in my <a href="/blog">blog posts</a>. Together, we shall traverse the infinite
		possibilities of technology, embracing the duality of light and darkness that permeates this
		digital realm.
	</p>

	<p>
		I extend my deepest gratitude for your presence here, for it is your curiosity and thirst for
		knowledge that fuels my relentless pursuit of technological enlightenment. Stay awhile, and allow
		the digital symphony to resonate within your soul.
	</p>

	<p>With utmost sincerity,</p>
	<p>Sahil Ashok Sawant<br />(aka. Samael Starshine)</p>
	<p>
		Thank you for venturing into the recesses of my digital existence. Embrace the unknown, for only
		then will you truly see.
