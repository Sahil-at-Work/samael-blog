## About Me

Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering Student | Astronomy Enthusiast | Cybersecurity Advocate

I am a B.Tech student in Electronics and Telecommunication at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, maintaining a CGPA of 8.4. My passion lies at the intersection of Physics, Communication Engineering, and Data-Driven approaches, demonstrated through award-winning projects and research contributions.

As the former President of Antariksh (VI's Astronomy Club) and founder of "Silverback - The Knight," I combine technical expertise with leadership to advance knowledge in astronomy and cybersecurity. Beyond academics, I find joy in writing regional literature, exploring philosophy, and playing classical Indian music.
